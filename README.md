# Diwali_sales_Analysis
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project on data analysis! ðŸŽ‰

I developed an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales using powerful libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy. ðŸ“Šâœ¨ This project involved:

- Cleaning and organizing the sales data with Pandas
- Visualizing key trends and insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib

This experience has greatly enhanced my skills in data manipulation and visualization, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior during the festive season. ðŸŒŸ
